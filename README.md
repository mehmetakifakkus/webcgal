# [Web Of <u>C</u>omputer Geometry Algorithms](http://webcgal.org:3000)
WebCgal is a web tool and abreviation of Web of Computer Geometry Algorithms. It is specialized to ease understanding computer geometry algorithms. 

Main features of the website are:

- It is written on javascript language and works on almost every web browser. (platform independent)
- You can see how algorithms work on live animation.
- You can modify codes on live. Therefore, you can try your own algorithm.

This computer geometry programmings are actually for learning the idea behind the algorithm visually. 
WebCgal uses mainly [paper.js](paperjs.org) javascript library and you can refer to it for reference.
